# The *scandi* Programming Language

*scandi* is a small programming language project I have undertaken in response to a friend's challenge.

The aim of the language is to have no 'keywords' -> though I will note the use of symbols instead could be construed as such.
*scandi* uses every symbol available on a standard keyboard, and a couple of digraphs where appropriate.

*scandi* makes use of spacing to indicate scope changes.

*scandi* uses a table-backed memory management system.

*scandi* provides a small standard library to work with - though currently it is a WIP.

The long term goal is to use [LLVM](https://llvm.org) to build a compiler, however in the meantime I will be starting with an interpreter to check language features.
