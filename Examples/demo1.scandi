` demo.scandi
` -----------
` By Neil Bradley
`
` Demonstrates all the features of the scandi language.

` Brings the print function in from demo2.scandi. Note that the file extension
` is implied. If we wanted to include the entirety of demo2, we could just
` include demo2, as {demo2}.
{demo2.print}

` This displays "scandi demo", and just demonstrates how to handle quote
` characters within strings.
'"'"scandi demo"'"' print
